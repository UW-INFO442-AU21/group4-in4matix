<h2>Our Mission </h2>

The goal of this application is to address feelings of imposter syndrome that women and minorities can experience in the tech field. To make the widely accepted variants of imposter syndrome seem less categorical, we have associated an Incredibles character with each archetype. 

This solution works specifically to address the United Nations 5th Sustainable Development Goal: Gender Equality. Imposter syndrome can limit the opportunites women and minorities are comfortable pursuing in their work environment.

# Development Instructions

## Start Localhost

`npm start`

`Ctrl + C` to cancel

## Deploy Build to GitHub Pages

`npm run deploy`

## Make a New Branch

Do these two steps in sequence to (1) make a new branch and (2) publish it to GitHub.

`git checkout -b <branch-name>`

`git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>`

Edit the branch as much as you'd like, push/pull freely, then when work is done make a Pull Request on the GitHub site.

### Double Checking the New Branch

If you run `git status`, the terminal should say

`On branch <branch-name>`  
`Your branch is up to date with 'origin/<branch-name>'.`
